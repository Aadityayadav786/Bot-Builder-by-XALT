Data Analytics
While we talk about data is the next new oil, most of the data are in unstructured formats distributed in various forms over multiple mediums, these data sets are highly rich on information but the big challenge is to mine and analyze such unstructured data.
With stellar growth in cloud computing deep learning techniques, it is now possible to derive meaning out of these complex unstructured data using Machine learning tools and derive signals that can make a significant impact in business decisions and can also help in predicting future outcomes for both business & consumers.
We help our clients in filtering noise from such “unstructured data” of any forms such as ;
Text Data : Recognize handwritten contents, scanned data, message data, text files, emails, numerical or textual log  data, web pages, any other business documents including social media data distributed in any form including extracting  information from emoticons
Image Data : Identify moods and sentiment of individual or group of an individual by analyzing photographs and  images, gif files etc.
Video Data : Analyze real-time or static video data by utilizing advanced algorithms thereby turning video files into actionable intelligence and insights
Audio Data : Analyze audio files using Artificial Neural Networks and by classifying audio files such as mobile call data, call centre call records to decipher insights and improve on QA & QC

AI & ML Model Creation
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are related fields that involve the development and use of computer systems that can learn and adapt to new data.
AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. There are many different types of AI, including narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and general or strong AI, which has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can.
Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable a system to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on a dataset and then used to make predictions or decisions based on new data.
There are many applications for AI and machine learning in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, marketing, and cybersecurity. Some common examples include recommendation systems, fraud detection, and image and speech recognition.

Big Data Analytics
Big data analytics is the process of collecting, storing, and analyzing large and complex datasets to uncover insights and trends from varied, high-volume, high-velocity datasets. These datasets are characterized by the 3Vs: volume, variety, and velocity. It is often too large in volume to be stored and processed on a single computer or server and may come in a variety of different formats and types such as from structured (database tables, Excel sheets) to semi-structured (XML files, webpages) to unstructured (images, audio files). It is also generated at a high velocity, meaning that it is collected and generated at a rapid rate, making it difficult to process in real time using traditional systems.
Big data analytics involves using advanced technologies and algorithms to extract valuable information from large volumes of data, and to use that information to make better-informed business decisions. One of the key tools used in big data analytics is Hadoop, a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.

Ai & ml model creation
AI & ML Model Creation
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are related fields that involve the development and use of computer systems that can learn and adapt to new data.
AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. There are many different types of AI, including narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and general or strong AI, which has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can.
Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable a system to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on a dataset and then used to make predictions or decisions based on new data.
There are many applications for AI and machine learning in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, marketing, and cybersecurity. Some common examples include recommendation systems, fraud detection, and image and speech recognition.

Big data analytics
Big Data Analytics
Big data analytics is the process of collecting, storing, and analyzing large and complex datasets to uncover insights and trends from varied, high-volume, high-velocity datasets. These datasets are characterized by the 3Vs: volume, variety, and velocity. It is often too large in volume to be stored and processed on a single computer or server and may come in a variety of different formats and types such as from structured (database tables, Excel sheets) to semi-structured (XML files, webpages) to unstructured (images, audio files). It is also generated at a high velocity, meaning that it is collected and generated at a rapid rate, making it difficult to process in real time using traditional systems.
Big data analytics involves using advanced technologies and algorithms to extract valuable information from large volumes of data, and to use that information to make better-informed business decisions. One of the key tools used in big data analytics is Hadoop, a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.

AI & Machine Learning
AI is a broad field that encompasses a variety of approaches and techniques for building intelligent systems. At its core, AI aims to create algorithms that can perform tasks that would normally require human-level intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, learning from data, and making decisions. Some common examples of AI include natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, and game playing.
ML is a subfield of AI that involves using algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms are designed to improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data. For example, a machine learning model might be trained to recognize faces in images bhy being fed a large dataset of images labeled with the names of the people in them. As the model is exposed to more data, it will become better at identifying faces in new images.
There are several different types of ML algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the training data is labeled with the correct output, and the goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs. An example of a supervised learning task might be classifying emails as spam or not spam based on a dataset of labeled emails.
In unsupervised learning, the training data is not labeled, and the goal is to discover patterns or relationships in the data. An example of an unsupervised learning task might be clustering a dataset of customer data into groups based on common characteristics.
Reinforcement learning is a type of ML in which an agent learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or punishments based on its actions. An example of reinforcement learning might be a robot learning to navigate a maze by trial and error.
AI and ML have a wide range of applications in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and manufacturing. For example, AI and ML can be used to analyze medical images for early detection of diseases, automate financial trading, improve logistics and supply chain management, and optimize manufacturing processes.
Few examples are as:-
1. Autonomous vehicles: AI and ML can be used to enable self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, and make decisions in real-time.
2. Medical diagnosis: AI and ML can be used to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans, to detect early signs of diseases or abnormalities. This can enable early diagnosis and treatment, improving patient outcomes.
3. Personalized medicine: AI and ML can be used to analyze patient data, such as medical records and genetic data, to identify personalized treatment options for individual patients.
4. Financial fraud detection: AI and ML can be used to analyze financial transactions in real-time to detect patterns indicative of fraud, enabling early detection and prevention of fraudulent activities.
5. Predictive analytics: AI and ML can be used to analyze data from a variety of sources to make predictions about future events or trends. This can be used, for example, to improve supply chain management or optimize marketing campaigns.
6. Natural language processing: AI and ML can be used to enable intelligent systems to understand and respond to human language, enabling applications such as voice-activated assistants or intelligent chatbots, AI powered blog writing, text modification, language transation, information extraction etc.
7.Personalization: AI can be used to personalize the shopping experience for individual customers based on their past purchases, browsing history, and other data. This can include recommendations for products or services, customized email and advertising campaigns, and personalized search results.
In conclusion, AI and ML are complex and rapidly evolving fields that have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries and applications. As more data becomes available and new techniques are developed, we can expect to see even more exciting advances in the field in the future.

Image analytics using facial recognition technology is a type of AI that involves using computer algorithms to analyze and recognize human faces from digital images or video. This technology has a wide range of potential applications, including security, where it can be used to identify individuals in real-time for access control or surveillance purposes.
To work effectively, facial recognition systems typically require a large dataset of images of faces to be used for training the algorithms. These images are usually labeled with identifying information, such as the name of the person or a unique identifier, which allows the system to learn to recognize specific individuals.
Facial recognition technology has the potential to improve security in a number of ways, such as by enabling automatic identification of individuals at border crossings, airports, and other secure locations, or by helping to identify and track individuals in real-time in public spaces.
One example of the use of image analytics in facial recognition is the deployment of a system by the Metropolitan Police in London, UK. The system was designed to help identify individuals in real-time as they moved through public spaces, with the goal of detecting and preventing crime.
To use the system, police officers would input a photograph of an individual they wanted to track into the system, and the system would then scan live video feeds from cameras located around the city to try to identify the individual. If a match was found, the system would alert the officers, who could then take appropriate action, such as stopping and questioning the individual or following them to gather more information.
So image analytics using facial recognition technology can have many legitimate and valuable uses in a range of settings, including security, law enforcement, and other areas where the ability to accurately identify individuals is important. However, it is important for organizations to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of using this technology, as well as to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect privacy and prevent misuse.
Image analytics in Retail and e-commerce:-
Another real-world example of the use of image analytics is in the retail industry, where it is being used to optimize the layout and display of products in stores.
In this case, image analytics algorithms are used to analyze images of store shelves and displays to identify patterns and trends in how customers interact with the products. This can include information on which products are most popular, how long customers spend looking at particular products, and which products are most likely to be purchased.
Using this information, retailers can then optimize the layout and display of products in their stores to increase sales and improve the shopping experience for customers. For example, they might rearrange the layout of products on shelves to make it easier for customers to find what they are looking for, or they might move high-selling products to more prominent locations in the store.
Overall, the use of image analytics in retail can help businesses to better understand customer behavior and preferences, and to use this knowledge to increase sales and improve the customer experience. However, it is important for retailers to consider the potential privacy implications of collecting and analyzing images of customers in their stores.

Application of Machine Learning
Consumer-deviant behavior costs global utility firms USD 96 billion yearly, attributable to Non-Technical Losses (NTLs). NTLs affect the operations of power systems by overloading lines and transformers, resulting in voltage imbalances and, thereby, impacting services. They also impact the electricity price paid by the honest customers. Traditional meters constitute 98 % of the total electricity meters in India. This paper argues that while traditional meters have their limitation in checking consumer-deviant behavior, this issue can be resolved with ML-based algorithms. These algorithms can predict suspected cases of theft with reasonable certainty, thereby enabling distribution companies to save money and provide consistent and dependable services to honest customers at reasonable costs. The key learning from this paper is that even if data is noisy, it is possible to create a Machine Learning Model to detect NTL with 80 percentage plus accuracy.

For electronic component manufacturing company, we did an elaborative data-driven EDA (Exploratory data analysis). The dataset was about the various defects in the products across each shit across each product. They were utilizing various methods to mitigate the defects. So the goal was to identify the defect distribution across each product across each operator and to answer various questions such as which method is best for reducing the defect. Which product get which type of defect? Which shift has effective working in terms of revenue generation for the company? What methods are efficient in reducing which defect? And many more business-related questions. We created a satisfactory EDA on the data set and answered all the logical questions in terms of visualization that are easy to understand and make decisions. We dashboard the result in a very interactive manner using plotly dash and google charts.

For a financial institute We did a complete EDA (Exploratory data analysis) and ML modeling to understand the behavior of their customers. We did various analyses on the dataset to identify the probability of default. In which segment and what level of POD? We did data analysis to identify the customer churn pattern and the areas that can be improved that determine what type of customers are generating high revenue and what type of customers are probable to churn. This helped in reducing the overall NPA for the institute. We have also determined the customer life cycle value (predictive modeling) that helps in identifying which customer can generate what level of revenue for an institute.

Named Entity Recognition
Named Entity Recognition
For a large electronic component manufacturing company, we have created a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify and extract the different types of information from the image labels in order to improve the company's efficiency and automate the information extraction. These labels contain text information about the product. We trained the transformer-based NER model to extract these entities and classify them under their specific labels.

Multilabel Text Classification
Multilabel Text Classification
We created a multilabel classification problem where We classified text with their respective class such that it may belong to multiclass at the same time. Also along with the class, We have to predict the two labels a specific email belongs to. This I did by using state-of-the-art models such as BERT, and Transformers. Here We used Context-based AI language models for the classification task.

Multiclass Classification
Multiclass Classification
For the electronic component quality validation company, We created an NLP solution to correct the classes name of a component based on its description and other attributes. As it was a very complex problem So we have built various levels of NLP solutions as a complete package. We combined the various NLP models by creating granularity in the data set. We were having around 3000+ classes in which we need to put the components.

Recommendation System
Recommendation System
For a leading publishing house in the UK, We created a recommendation system for their online subscription service. The goal here was that each user should see books from their favorite topics upon login into the service. There were about 10 thousand books and roughly 2000 subscribers. The additional challenge was that since these were mainly subscribers of technical books we had to make sure that the latest books were recommended always.
The second project was for a cellular company and here We had to recommend the top 5 offers to over a million consumers. The additional challenge was that the recommendation should lead to an increase in revenue.
We developed a recommendation system for a job portal where they wanted us to create a recommendation system that gives them a better performance than the equivalent google platform. We created the recommendation model and then worked with their team to implement the same on AWS.

Some common examples of AI include natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, and game playing.
ML is a subfield of AI that involves using algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms are designed to improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data. For example, a machine learning model might be trained to recognize faces in images bhy being fed a large dataset of images labeled with the names of the people in them. As the model is exposed to more data, it will become better at identifying faces in new images.
There are several different types of ML algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the training data is labeled with the correct output, and the goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs. An example of a supervised learning task might be classifying emails as spam or not spam based on a dataset of labeled emails.
In unsupervised learning, the training data is not labeled, and the goal is to discover patterns or relationships in the data. An example of an unsupervised learning task might be clustering a dataset of customer data into groups based on common characteristics.
Reinforcement learning is a type of ML in which an agent learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or punishments based on its actions. An example of reinforcement learning might be a robot learning to navigate a maze by trial and error.

Image analytics using facial recognition technology is a type of AI that involves using computer algorithms to analyze and recognize human faces from digital images or video. This technology has a wide range of potential applications, including security, where it can be used to identify individuals in real-time for access control or surveillance purposes.
To work effectively, facial recognition systems typically require a large dataset of images of faces to be used for training the algorithms. These images are usually labeled with identifying information, such as the name of the person or a unique identifier, which allows the system to learn to recognize specific individuals.
Facial recognition technology has the potential to improve security in a number of ways, such as by enabling automatic identification of individuals at border crossings, airports, and other secure locations, or by helping to identify and track individuals in real-time in public spaces.
One example of the use of image analytics in facial recognition is the deployment of a system by the Metropolitan Police in London, UK. The system was designed to help identify individuals in real-time as they moved through public spaces, with the goal of detecting and preventing crime.
To use the system, police officers would input a photograph of an individual they wanted to track into the system, and the system would then scan live video feeds from cameras located around the city to try to identify the individual. If a match was found, the system would alert the officers, who could then take appropriate action, such as stopping and questioning the individual or following them to gather more information.
So image analytics using facial recognition technology can have many legitimate and valuable uses in a range of settings, including security, law enforcement, and other areas where the ability to accurately identify individuals is important. However, it is important for organizations to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of using this technology, as well as to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect privacy and prevent misuse.
Image analytics in Retail and e-commerce:-
Another real-world example of the use of image analytics is in the retail industry, where it is being used to optimize the layout and display of products in stores.
In this case, image analytics algorithms are used to analyze images of store shelves and displays to identify patterns and trends in how customers interact with the products. This can include information on which products are most popular, how long customers spend looking at particular products, and which products are most likely to be purchased.
Using this information, retailers can then optimize the layout and display of products in their stores to increase sales and improve the shopping experience for customers. For example, they might rearrange the layout of products on shelves to make it easier for customers to find what they are looking for, or they might move high-selling products to more prominent locations in the store.
Overall, the use of image analytics in retail can help businesses to better understand customer behavior and preferences, and to use this knowledge to increase sales and improve the customer experience. However, it is important for retailers to consider the potential privacy implications of collecting and analyzing images of customers in their stores.

Application of machine learning
Consumer-deviant behavior costs global utility firms USD 96 billion yearly, attributable to Non-Technical Losses (NTLs). NTLs affect the operations of power systems by overloading lines and transformers, resulting in voltage imbalances and, thereby, impacting services. They also impact the electricity price paid by the honest customers. Traditional meters constitute 98 % of the total electricity meters in India. This paper argues that while traditional meters have their limitation in checking consumer-deviant behavior, this issue can be resolved with ML-based algorithms. These algorithms can predict suspected cases of theft with reasonable certainty, thereby enabling distribution companies to save money and provide consistent and dependable services to honest customers at reasonable costs. The key learning from this paper is that even if data is noisy, it is possible to create a Machine Learning Model to detect NTL with 80 percentage plus accuracy.

Case Study: Text Analytics in Customer Service and support
A large online retailer decided to use text analytics to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its customer service department. The company's customer service representatives received a high volume of inquiries via email and social media, and the company wanted to find a way to better understand and respond to these inquiries in a timely and helpful manner.
To do this, the company implemented a text analytics system that analyzed the content of customer inquiries and automatically assigned them to appropriate categories based on the topic of the inquiry. For example, inquiries about order tracking were automatically routed to the order tracking team, while inquiries about returns were routed to the returns team.
The text analytics system also automatically generated responses to common inquiries, such as how to track an order or how to return an item. These responses were reviewed by human customer service representatives to ensure their accuracy and helpfulness, and were then sent to customers automatically.
The implementation of the text analytics system had a number of benefits for the company's customer service department. It reduced the workload of human customer service representatives by automating many routine tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex inquiries. It also improved the speed and accuracy of responses to customers, leading to higher levels of customer satisfaction.
Overall, the use of text analytics in customer service helped the company to improve efficiency and effectiveness, leading to cost savings and increased profits. It also helped the company to better understand and respond to the needs of its customers, leading to improved customer loyalty and retention.
